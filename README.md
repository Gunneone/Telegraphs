**These Jupyter Notebooks are meant to give you some nice statistics about your Telegram Usage.**

---

## To get started:
1. Install Jupyter Notebook if not installed allready. I suggest [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. [Export your Telegram History](https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more) as json via the [Telegram Desktop Client](https://desktop.telegram.org/).
3. Place the exported file 'result.json' in the notebooks folder.
4. Install missing packages by typing ```pip install *package name*``` into console
5. Open Telegraphs.ipynb via Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells.
